# This code is for the Biosemi trigger interface.
# The class inherits from the serial.Serial class, and so has all the same methods and attributes.
# All methods are documented below for clarity, but these are not extrictly required to be used. 
# Same functionality can be achieved by using the built in methods of the serial.Serial class.
# Besides the methods' documentation, check https://www.biosemi.com/faq/USB%20Trigger%20interface%20cable.htm for additional details.

        Initialize the serial port. If an initial delay is needed, add it here. In some
        cases, the device needs time to initialize the serial connection. We advice to test it
        empirically (e.g., with an oscilloscope) if needed.

        Args:
            Serial_Port (string) - the port to initialize the serial port on.
            
            initial_delay (float) - the delay to wait after initializing the serial port.

        Returns:
            serialport (serial.Serial) - the initialized serial port object.

        To find your device's serial port, run `ls /dev/tty*` in the terminal, or `python -m serial.tools.list_ports` in python.

            Valid values are `0b00000001` (trigger 1), `0b00000010` (trigger 2), `0b00000100` (trigger 3), `0b00001000` (trigger 4), etc.
